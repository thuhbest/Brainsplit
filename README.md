# 🧠 BrainSplit – A Game for People with Too Much Brain

Welcome to **BrainSplit**, the world’s first split-brain browser game designed to challenge your **logical** and **creative** minds at the same time.

## 🎮 What It Does
BrainSplit places you in control of two sides of your brain — literally:
- The **Left Brain** side throws logic-based mini-challenges (math, patterns, sequences).
- The **Right Brain** side serves creative puzzles (color match, emojis, reaction taps).

Solve both sides **simultaneously** — or lose. Simple? Try it.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The game runs in the browser using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (with optional p5.js for animations).
- A dual game loop renders and updates the left and right panels independently, creating a multitasking challenge.
- Dynamic timers on each side reset with every success.
- Funny dialogue adds humor as the left and right brains argue for your attention.

## 💡 Why It’s Different
Most games test either memory, reflexes, or problem-solving. BrainSplit tests **all three**, at the same time — in split view:
- You think in *parallel*.
- You feel overwhelmed, then addicted.
- You die laughing… then hit replay.

This is a **zero-to-one** idea — not a clone, not a variation. Just you, your two brains, and chaos.
